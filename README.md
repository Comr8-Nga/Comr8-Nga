I’m @Comr8-Nga. I'm providing professional node running services as an individual.

I have ready infrastructure for rapid deploy a new testnet or mainnet nodes in most popular ecosystems (Polkadot substrate and Cosmos tendermint).

Now I am a validator in Mina, Solana (mainnet and testnet) and Realis networks.

Participation in testnets as a validator: Casper Labs, Near, Solana, Coda(mina), Clover, NKN, Moonbeam, NYM, Hopr, BitCanna, Axelar. Former Ether miner. 

I've been fond of blockchain technologies since spring 2017.
